Unlike previous tools for in silico evolution, BioJazz allows for the evolution of cellular networks with theoretically unbounded complexity by combining rule-based modeling with an encoding of networks that is akin to a genome. BioJazz can be used to implement biologically realistic selective pressures and allows exploration of the space of network architectures and dynamics that implement prescribed physiological functions. BioJazz is provided as an open-source tool to facilitate its further development and use. <br>\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThis github organisation is currently owned by @LifeWorks, and will be transferred to another OSS lab member in future. If have any questions please contant @LifeWorks.",
